## Implementation details

The service definition has been created under srv folder: srv/cat-service.cds

For testing:
(Prerequisites: run  `npm install` and `cds build/all` in the console)
If you come from the data_model branch you already have done `npm install` and `cds build/all`.

- Open a new terminal and run `cds watch` 
- Open the url 'http://localhost:4004' and explore the available service endpoints
